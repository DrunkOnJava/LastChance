## Cross-References in Database

The database tracks page-to-page references to ensure consistency. Key cross-references include:
- Construction requirements (Page 11) reference ARC contact info
- Fire safety (Page 9) references emergency contacts
- Social events (Page 7) reference The Lodge (Page 8)
- Trail information (Page 20) references natural features (Pages 16-17)

## Missing Elements from BMPOA-Outline.md

The database structure closely follows the outline with these variations:
- Appendices A-E mentioned in outline are not in the 20-page structure
- Emergency contact list is integrated into database rather than appendix
- Map/atlas content referenced but not assigned page numbers

## Next Steps for Completion

1. Finalize remaining 19 pages with approved content only
2. Ensure all cross-references are accurate
3. Verify all contact information matches BMPOA-entities.txt
4. Add only images that exist in the approved image inventory
5. Remove any content flagged in FLAGGED-CONTENT.md
