### Critical Issues

#### 1. Margin Violations (2,467 failures)
Almost all failures are related to elements extending beyond the safe print zone. This is a critical issue that could result in content being cut off during printing.

**Most Affected Pages**:
1. Page 21: 189 violations
2. Page 28: 174 violations  
3. Page 14: 149 violations
4. Page 27: 146 violations
5. Page 25: 138 violations

**Affected Elements**:
- DIV elements
- SPAN elements
- Paragraphs (P)
- Headings (H3)
- Tables (TD)
- Line breaks (BR)
- Strong text (STRONG)

### What Passed
✅ All 33 pages have correct dimensions (8.5" x 11")
✅ Content flows properly between pages
✅ All page break rules are respected

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Apply Margin Fix CSS**: Created `fix-margin-violations.css` to address boundary issues
2. **Content Overflow**: Elements are extending beyond the printable area
3. **Table Formatting**: Tables need fixed layout to prevent column overflow
4. **Word Breaking**: Long text strings need proper word-wrap rules

### Root Causes
1. **Professional styling elements** added recently may have introduced wider layouts
2. **Tables without proper width constraints**
3. **Long URLs or email addresses** not wrapping properly
4. **Nested DIVs** with cumulative padding/margins

### Recommended Fixes
1. Add `fix-margin-violations.css` to the document
2. Review and constrain all table widths
3. Ensure all text content has proper word-break rules
4. Test print preview after each fix
5. Consider reducing page content padding from 0.75" to 0.5" for more content space

### Next Steps
1. Apply the margin violation fixes
2. Re-run the test suite
3. Focus on pages with highest violation counts first
4. Ensure all content remains readable after fixes
